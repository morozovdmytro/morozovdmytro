# Hi, I'm Dmytro 👋  

**Engineering Leader & Entrepreneur**  

I build global cloud-first platforms at scale for the last 10 years. 
Currently, I'm a **Director of Software Engineering at First Advantage**, leading distributed teams across Europe, United States, and India to deliver background screening platforms serving **hundreds of thousands of users worldwide**.  

Alongside corporate work, I co-founded startups in the **blockchain and AI** space:  
- **CodeFunded** – a whitelabel fundraising platform that enabled projects to raise **millions of dollars from thousands of investors**.  
- **Zoria** – leveraging AI and Machine Learning to generate creative and highly authentic content for e-commerce.  

💡 **What drives me**:  
- Translating **executive vision** into **scalable enterprise architectures and delivery roadmaps**  
- Building **high-performing engineering teams** across cultures and geographies  
- Leveraging **AI and automation** to save costs and increase customer satisfaction  
- Exploring **Web3** and next-gen UX for mainstream adoption  
- Staying **hands-on with coding**, prototyping POCs and Vibe Coding, keeping architecture flexible and modifiable for future industrialization

I actually code since age **12** (PHP, WordPress, Laravel), and got even more fascinated when built a **full security monitoring system in C++ and Arduino** during university years.
